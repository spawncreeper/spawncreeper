# 👾 Hey, I'm spawncreeper — accidental overachiever, intentional beginner

Welcome to my digital cave of curiosity and chaos.  
I’m a Computer Science major. I didn't grow up coding calculators or hacking mainframes.  
But one day I decided to understand the tech that runs the world — so here I am, blowing stuff up (metaphorically… mostly), learning CS from scratch, and documenting the whole journey.

## 📖 What I'm doing

- 📚 Learning Computer Science like a confused but determined NPC
- 🧠 Breaking and rebuilding basic concepts till they click
- 💻 Pushing buggy code, weird ideas, and mini-projects to GitHub
- 📹 Sharing everything — wins, fails, notes, experiments — on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@desmosspawncreeper)

## 🚧 Current Quest Log

- Figuring out how computers even work
- Writing code that doesn’t cry when compiled
- Understanding algorithms without losing sanity
- Occasionally pretending I know Linux
